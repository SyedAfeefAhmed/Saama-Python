# Saama-Python
As a part of my python training, I have created a project named as "Automation of PDF Processing".

In this project, I have encrypted few pdf files and then I have stored these encryption credentials into my database. Also, The project is built in such a way that it will also create a text file separately which will include the username and password of the encrypted files.
